# CS330-Comp-Graphic-Visualization
Throughout this course I worked on recreating a 3D scene from my hallway (a cabinet, decorative fur box, ornate lamp, and mirror). I applied various texture, shading, transformation, lighting, and camera techniques through OpenGL to produce a realistic interactive render.

# Final Reflection â€“ CS330 3D Scene Project

## How do I approach designing software?

When I start designing software, especially something visual like this 3D scene, I begin with the big picture. I think through what I want the final product to look and feel like, then start breaking that down into pieces I can actually build. I rely heavily on structure. I lay things out section by section, get each piece in place, then keep improving. I tend to design through experimentation, refining one part at a time until the whole thing feels complete.

## What new design skills did I develop?

This project pushed me to look deeper at realism and layering. I got better at thinking about how different objects interact in a 3D space and how to use textures, lighting, and scale to build something believable. I also improved how I document my work, keeping everything labeled, grouped, and commented so it stays readable. By the end, I was more comfortable designing for both the technical side and the visual result.

## What design process did I follow?

I followed a hands-on, build-as-you-go approach. I started with a reference image and mapped out what objects I needed. I added them in order, starting with the base floor and cabinet, then layering on the lamp and decorative details. I worked in clean sections inside my code so it was easy to come back later and make changes. I also kept testing how light and transparency behaved together, especially for the frosted glass and point light.

## How will I apply this process in the future?

This approach will absolutely carry over into future projects. I now know how valuable it is to build in layers and test visually as you go. Whether I am working in data visualization, user interface design, or even scripting backend logic, that sense of structure and refinement will stick with me. The ability to communicate visually through code is something I will keep applying and building on.

## How do I approach developing programs?

My programming approach is all about breaking things into steps. I usually start small, get the basic shape or logic working, then build on top of that. I like to test as I go and keep everything clean so I can debug easily if something does not work. In this project, that meant treating every object like its own puzzle. I dialed in placement, scale, texture, and lighting individually before moving on.

## What new development strategies did I use?

I learned a lot about working with transparency and lighting at the same time. Getting the glass to look frosted without killing the light glow underneath took some trial and error. I also explored how to layer textures more effectively, control draw order, and fix depth issues that would otherwise ruin the look. My use of shader materials improved, and I leaned into small UV and alpha adjustments to get the right finish on each object.

## How did iteration play a role?

Iteration was everything. Nothing looked perfect on the first try. I adjusted the lamp position several times to get it centered. I tested light placement until the glow effect looked right. I went back and tweaked textures to reduce repetition or improve contrast. Every step of this project involved testing something, catching what felt off, and trying again. That constant iteration is what made the scene feel polished in the end.

## How has my coding evolved?

Early on, I was just trying to get objects into the scene and have them show up. By the end, I was thinking about order, layering, material interaction, and clarity. My inline comments became more consistent and thoughtful. I organized the file using clean headers and spacing so everything was easy to read. I also made sure each section of code had a clear purpose and could be reused or modified without confusion.

## How does computer science help me reach my goals?

My goal is to move into a data analyst role, ideally working in HR or operations. Computer science gives me the foundation to solve problems efficiently and to think through technical challenges with a structured mindset. Even in a graphics-heavy course like this, I was constantly using logic, iteration, and design principles that translate directly into the work I want to do. Whether I am building dashboards or automating workflows, this experience makes me better equipped to deliver strong solutions.

## How does this course support my education?

This course taught me how to build something visual entirely through code. That helped me understand graphics rendering on a deeper level, especially how lighting, materials, and camera controls work together. It also gave me better instincts when working with other visualization tools. Even though I will not always be in OpenGL, the skills from this class carry over into how I design and present visuals in other environments.

## How does it support my future career?

In analytics, you often need to communicate complex data in a visual way. This course helped me learn how to structure a scene, apply detail, and use light and texture to tell a story. Those same principles apply to dashboard design, reporting, and stakeholder communication. I now have a stronger understanding of how to build something clean, visual, and interactive that actually helps people make decisions. That is a skill I plan to keep growing throughout my career.
